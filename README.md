# memories
The 3rd and final App of the Academinds Ionic-React.js course

In this app, you can save good and/or bad memories of your life, 
it is fully responsive and cross-platform. It has access to the 
device camera (after asking for permission) or to the gallery in
the case that the camera access is denied. I used The Ionic 
Framework in conjunction with React and Typescript and the Capacitor
APIs for device-hardware features (Camera, Local Storage, Gallery) 
and for building native android or ios bundles.
